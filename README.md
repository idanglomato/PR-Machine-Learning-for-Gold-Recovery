## Machine Learning for Gold Recovery

### Description
Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. This company operates in the field of developing efficient solutions for heavy industries.

The model you create should be able to predict the amount of gold extracted or obtained from gold ore. There is available data related to the process of extraction and refining of gold ore that you can use.

In the future, this model is expected to help create a more efficient production process and eliminate parameters that do not yield profits.

### Objectives
Develop a machine learning process to predict rougher output recovery and final output recovery from gold extraction process.
